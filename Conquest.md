# Conquest Target

The general formula for setting conquest is based on 80-90% of the previous week. For example, if we clear 3,000,000 CQ on a week, then the 80% would be 2.4m or medium yield. So long as we clear more than 6m CQ, I feel safe clearing large yield. The planet we invade doesn't really matter -- we won't conquer since we aren't a conquest-focused guild. Going for the largest yield we can consistently clear earns our troops more yield in loot for their work. This sets them up for the best experience when it comes to solo/team play. 

# Guildship Location

The *Starsider* should be over a planet that best befits us. Officers should review the weekly events and make recommendations in `#rest-and-relaxation` to Traitin to get the guildship moved.

1. Target location- and time-critical events first.
   * Gree event: Ilum
   * Nightlife Event, Feast of Prosperity: Nar Shaddaa Promenade
   * THORN: Alderaan, Tatooine, etc. as appropriate
   * Swoop Event: Dantooine
1. Target based on Galactic Seasons objectives next.
1. Target based on Conquest objectives next.
1. Target based on requests for reputation system quicktravels (such as Iokath) last.
1. When no other objective is indicated, target Ord Mantell for recruitment of new troopers.
