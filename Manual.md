## FOREWORD AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:
Republic Task Force Aurek is a guild formed by a tight knit group of friends that have been playing MMOs and other games together for many years, some of which have played pen and paper RPGs together since the early 90’s. Many of our leaders are current or former military veterans, so we are known for being highly organized. Republic Task Force Aurek can trace its roots to Imperial Task Force Aurek, a Stormtrooper roleplay guild on the Starsider Server of the Star Wars Galaxies MMO.

Republic Task Force Aurek’s main focus in this MMO, just like others before it, will be role-playing in a military style setting and PVP (player-versus-player). The idea being that we bring player content and immersion to the game by emulating a military unit as it would appear in the Star Wars setting.

Some might be surprised to hear that we do both PVP and heavy role-play, but one would not be properly roleplaying soldiers of the Republic if they were only to sit and roleplay in the cantina on the Republic Fleet.

With that being said, Republic Task Force Aurek is here to win the war against the Sith Empire. We have the organization, the teamwork, and the leadership to make it happen.

I would also like to thank Alpha Company of the Jung Ma server of whom I have had the honor and pleasure of being a part of for several years. In fact, this organization served as a template for both Republic Task Force Aurek as a guild and this very manual, which is heavily influenced by their fine example.

We prefer our members to be mature in nature. Additionally, we employ a program called “Discord” for voice communications; we cannot be held liable for what kind of mature conversations that may take place.
1. Recruits must have a name acceptable to RP standards.

### Requirements After Enlisting:
Upon enlistment in the 121st, you are assigned the rank of Private. This is a probationary rank and means that you are being assessed at all times on your performance in the guild, contributing to the team activeness in guild events, etc.

To advance to the rank of Private First Class, a Private must do the following:
* Write a character biography and post it in the “personnel-dossiers” section of the RTAF Discord channel.
* Attain the maximum level (80) in a reasonable timeframe.
* Be online regularly to avoid being kicked for lack of progress.

    * -avoid the use of exessive profanity, racial, sexual or derogatory comments that might offend some members. If someone asks you to cool it, apologize and move on. With that said, if a pattern forms and complaints persist, you will be removed for causing guild drama. The 121st is a drama-free guild.

## ALTERNATE CHARACTERS:
Additional characters on your account are welcome and encouraged to join as long as they meet our recruitment standards. Make sure you denote which character is your primary. All other characters will be designated as reservist and will not be eligible for promotion past the rank of Specialist. All guild rules and regulations apply to alt’s, including logging in at least once every 30 days, or they are subject to being removed. You are permitted to have one Main and up to two Alts in the guild at a time.

## CORE REPUBLIC ARMY VALUES:

> Inspired by [US Army Values](https://www.army.mil/values/)

Loyalty: Bear true faith and allegiance to the Republic, the Republic Army, your unit and other soldiers.

Duty: Fulfill your obligations.

Respect: Treat people as they should be treated.

Selfless Service:  Put the welfare of the Republic, the Republic Army, and your subordinates before your own.

Honor: Live up to all of the Republic Army values.

Integrity: Do what is right, legally and morally.

Personal Courage: Face fear, danger, or adversity (physically or mentally).

## CODE OF CONDUCT:
* You have the right to voice anything to guild officers using /whisper, in-game mail, or Discord PM. Whether it is a complaint, praise, or suggestion.
* You have the right to be treated with respect. If any member violates this right, please approach an officer.
* You have the right to take a break from the game at any time. However, please inform us, or you will be removed from the guild after 30 days.
* You have the right to leave the 121st at any time if you feel that it is no longer right for you.
* Be generous. If you are given something, reward others by giving in turn.
* Answer a call for help by any 121st Infantry Regiment member when possible.
* When a call is put out for all 121st Infantry Regiment members to respond, you will respond. Remember, we are an army of one!
* Rank titles are only displayed if they are the same as your guild rank.
* All members are required to achieve a minimum gear rating of 328 after reaching level 80.
* Legacy names are to be displayed at all times on your primary character.
* All other titles are acceptable if they are justifiable in a role-play setting.
* Do not create drama! Anyone causing drama that the commanding officer or executive officer have to spend more than ten minutes having to deal with will be subject to probation and possibly removal from the guild.
* Where possible, members will attempt to use the chain of command when addressing questions and concerns so as to alleviate the workload of our officers.

## 121ST INFANTRY REGIMENT MEMBERS WILL IMMEDIATELY BE REMOVED FOR THE FOLLOWING:
* Griefing, slandering, childish treatment, and rude emotes are not allowed. “Deeds, not words'' will apply when dealing with the enemy. If they slander you, ignore them- you will make them look like morons. This will be enforced. Some of our members have friends or alts on the Imperial Side. We will find out. Generally, RP banter is allowed, but know the line and do not cross it.
* Botting, hacking, exploiting, or general cheating. No use of third-party programs, etc. will be tolerated. This includes afk-ing warzones.
* Any action that is seen to degrade 121st Infantry Regiment’s image in the eyes of its allies and the Satele Shan server community.
* Failure to respond to a call-to-arms in guild chat or Discord without good reason.
* Elitism: behavior contrary to the spirit of 121st Infantry Regiment’s “army of one” mentality.

###  PERSONAL LEAVE:
* Members who hold the rank of Private First Class or above may take personal leave from the game.
* Privates who require personal leave will be removed from the guild and will be required to reapply.
* Members have the right to take personal leave up to 30 days from the game as we are very understanding of people’s lives, jobs, work, and family.
* With that being said the following applies:
* Members must post a thread in the personal leave thread on the discord saying why and how long they will be gone. If it is a personal reason, please discuss this directly with an officer and post the reason as personal.
* Once a member has returned, they must post in the thread informing of their return.

### LEAVE OF ABSENCE:
If you are required to take a leave of absence in excess of 30 days, you will be removed from the guild. When you return, you will be added to the guild without being required to re-apply, at the discretion of the commanding officer. (Applies when there are over 250 active guild members)

### RESIGNATION:
We realize that sometimes members are unable to continue playing the game due to financial reasons, school, work, moving, military deployments, courses, etc.

If you intend to leave the game, please let us know and we will temporarily remove your character. Should you return to the game, you will not have to reapply.

### DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS:

#### PROBATION:
Probation can be as short as a day or as long as a few months. Any further violations of the code of conduct during your probation will result in a dishonorable discharge. Details below.

#### RESTRICTED DUTY:
Restricted duty will most likely come about for one of two reasons: not following orders during a raid or not following the RP protocol during an RP event. During your restricted duty, you will not be allowed to participate in that type of event. Restricted duty, or RD, will usually last for no more than a week. At the end of your RD period, you may be required to attend a “remedial training.” After that, you will be put back on full duty.

#### RESTITUTION:
Restitution may require reimbursement of credits or time replacement of the item in question.

#### DEMOTION:
Demotion or loss or rank will be punishment for inactivity in the guild. This will especially be true for members in leadership positions such as NCOs and officers who are expected to be on and participate in events on a regular basis. NCOs and officers are expected to lead by example and it is hard to do that when they are not on. As a general guideline, you will lose one rank for roughly 30 days of inactivity.

#### HONORABLE DISCHARGE:
Any 121st Infantry Regiment member with the rank of Private First Class or above that resigns from the guild or is removed for being on a leave of absence will receive an honorable discharge from service. An honorable discharge is as follows: should you choose to return within 30 days of your discharge, you will not be required to reapply and will be given the highest non-leadership rank you had achieved before discharge. If you choose to return after 30 days from discharge, you will need to reapply to the guild and go through the same process as any new recruit would.

#### DISHONORABLE DISCHARGE:
Repeat violations to the code of conduct, or a violation while on probation, or desertion, i.e., not logging in for a period of over 30 or days without going on personal leave or taking a leave of absence, will result in a dishonorable discharge. It can in some cases, however, come from just one violation of the code of conduct. The following actions will be taken against anyone who is dishonorably discharged from service:
* You will immediately be removed from the guild.
* You will be banned from the 121st Infantry Regiment Discord channel.
* You will be banned from the Republic Task Force headquarters and flagship.
* You will be unable to reapply to 121st Infantry Regiment in the future. furthermore, all members should ban and ignore anyone that has been dishonorably discharged.

## MILITARY COURTESY:
Military courtesy is simply the display of good manners and politeness when dealing with other members of the military. Military courtesy conveys respect from both subordinate and senior to each other.

### SALUTING:
Members will salute all officers. Members can easily identify officers by the color of their blue, red, or yellow armor markings.

When approaching or being approached by a single officer, simply salute the officer and the officer will return the salute.

When a group of troopers approach or are approached by a single officer, the highest ranked member of the group will salute the officer on behalf of the rest. For example, a Staff Sergeant is with his squad and is approached by an officer, only the Staff Sergeant will salute.

When alone and approaching or approached by several officers, the member will salute the highest ranked officer present. For example, you are approaching a Lieutenant and a Major walking together. You would salute the Major.

When in a group and approaching or approached by a group of officers, the highest ranked member of the group will salute the highest ranked officer.

It is considered good etiquette to greet the officer you are saluting with “Good morning, day, or evening, sir!”, depending on the appropriate time of day. As an alternative, you could use your battalion motto, followed by “sir!.” For example, “It shall be done, sir!” would be appropriate for members of the 121st infantry regiment.

It is also inappropriate for enlisted to salute non-officers. For example, Privates do not salute Sergeants.

Do not salute while indoors. The only structures in which it is appropriate to salute inside are on board a ship, on the Republic fleet, or in the commanding officer’s office when ordered to report to him/her.

Any other questions on this subject can be brought to the attention of company leadership.

### IMPORTANT:
Saluting is only to be done in garrison or any designated safe area- do not salute anyone in a field environment or while in an active combat zone. This is due to the possibility of there being snipers or enemy observers in the area. We do not want to identify our officers to the enemy.

### ADDRESSING MILITARY MEMBERS:
Enlisted members addressing any officer or an officer addressing an officer that is higher ranking than him or herself will address that officer as sir or ma'am as appropriate.

When addressing any other member, it is appropriate to address them by their rank.

Note, it is acceptable to address all NCOs ranked Sergeant to Sergeant First Class simply as “Sergeant”. The same applies to both Second and First Lieutenants. It is acceptable to address them both simply as “Lieutenant”.

## “AN ARMY OF ONE” AND WHAT IT MEANS TO US:
**THE ATTITUDE THAT DEFINES US:**
Our slogan, “ARMY OF ONE” represents several things, but more than anything it represents an attitude that defines us as a guild.
We fight together – strength in numbers – Troopers may not be the best class in the game, but when we show up in numbers, we are unstoppable.

We are sociable – most of our members spend a great deal of time on Discord voice comms, if not all of their online time. As a group, we have become great friends and colleagues. We have shared some amazing accomplishments, and experience almost non-stop humor from a great number of our more comical members.

We group together – no divisions – no elitism – members group together regardless of “judgment” of another member’s skill. This prevents cliques and divides from forming. This includes PVP and PVE. You will branch out and play with members you haven’t grouped with before and you will assist new members.

We train together – if you are a good PVP’er, teach others – if you are a good PVE’er, teach others. As our numbers increase, so do we as we gain more experience and knowledge from new members.

No ego – if you think you are better than everyone, close this training manual and find another guild. You are allowed to be proud of 121st Infantry Regiment’s achievements, but we achieve as a group and no one person can claim responsibility. This guild isn’t about how good you are, it’s about how good WE are.

Deeds not words – we let our actions speak for us. 121st Infantry Regiment has plenty of accomplishments, but those who like to brag or emote the many corpses that 121st Infantry Regiment creates in our wake, need not apply.

Cooperation – limiting drama – drama is natural in large guilds – not everyone is perfectly suited to work with everyone else in a group. However, cooperation and understanding overcome all situations. Interpersonal issues should be dealt with at the lowest level and kept in perspective.

Leadership – step up – lead by example – we have strong leadership in our guild. Many with real military experience. Unlike some guilds, our guild doesn’t depend on its officers. The Sergeant’s plan and lead events. The officers administrate and lead large engagements just like in the real military. We have a chain of command - and it works!

Lack of individuality – we abandon our freedoms to wear whatever gear we want, so that we all look the same. This likeness gives us a level of intimidation and attention that sets us apart from all the other trooper guilds to date.

## THE CALL TO ARMS – RESPONDING TO QUICK REACTION CALL:

121st Infantry Regiment responds to calls for assistance against the Sith on a very regular basis.

If an allied guild or Republic player makes a request for assistance, 121st Infantry Regiment will muster and assist when possible. Our reputation amongst the Republic and our allies is of the utmost importance  to us.

The same goes for requests from members of our own guild. If a Sergeant or above puts out the word for you to report to a planet, you will report!

The only three exceptions are:
* If you are in the middle of an Operation.
* You are in a group finder Flashpoint or Uprising.
* If you are in a Warzone or Galactic Starfighter Match.

As soon as you are finished with any of the above, make your way to the call-to-arms location and report. We do not jeopardize our reputation as a guild by bailing out on groups that we have committed to.

## FLASHPOINT/UPRISING PROCEDURES AND LOOT POLICIES:

**WHEN GROUPED WITH NON-GUILD MEMBERS IN A MIXED PICK UP GROUP/GROUP FINDER:**

Please show respect at all times and show a good image of RTFA so our reputation stays in good standing in the overall community.

## OPERATION PROCEDURES AND LOOT POLICIES:

### INVITE PRIORITY:

Invite priority will be given to those that are part of the normal progression group and are signed up for or are tentative for the event, on time and based on operation composition needs.

Random people will be used to fill the remaining spots as needed.

Make sure your gear is ready to go and that you meet any minimum gear score before the start of the operation. During an operation is not the time to look for stims or augments that new piece of gear you just got.A

### BEFORE THE START OF THE OPERATION:

Be on time! be at the operation entrance and ready to go prior to the event starting! If we have to wait for more than five minutes for you, you will be replaced.

The operation will start on time! At t+5 minutes, we will start pulling.

Come with a positive attitude!

When possible, try to know the boss fights ahead of time.

Discord is required for all operations.

If you are on the operation, you must commit to being there as long as necessary {3 hours max}.

### DURING THE OPERATION:

The raid leader has absolute authority over all matters regarding the operation.

The only one talking in Discord during boss fights will be the raid leader and the raid assistants.

Only the raid leader or raid assistants will make the call to use battle rez abilities. This is to prevent key raid members from not being able to be revived when needed due to battle rez abilities being on cooldown.

Do not wait for a revive if we wipe. Release and run back.

If you get disconnected, you will be given five minutes to come back. After five minutes, you will be removed from the group. If you reconnect in ten minutes, you will be given your spot back. If you disconnect twice in a 30 minute period, you will be removed from the group.

### OPERATION PROCEDURES AND LOOT POLICIES:
**BREAKS:** There will be two five minute breaks during the raid that will be called out by the raid leader. Five minutes means just that, five minutes, not ten. If you are more than five minutes past the scheduled time. If you need a quick bathroom break, then ask for one at any point.

There will be no breaks taken after wipes or after a boss is killed except to go over the strategy again if needed.
If you are taking long breaks or breaks without authorization, you may be removed from the raid. Remember, when you take long breaks, you are holding up seven other people that are ready to go.

All crafting material drops will be placed in the guild bank for guild use.

All decoration drops will be collected and donated to the guild.
