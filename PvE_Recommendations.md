# Personal Maintenance

Being prepared for unit content is more than just showing up. 

## Preparation

In general, preparation makes the victor.

* Make sure that you have stims, adrenals, and medpacks to cover whatever time you are attending for -- if you're showing up for a two-hour event, have four hours of supplies just in case the event runs long.
* Have your gear in your inventory for all load-outs and roles you are able to fill. This ensures that if a role is unexpectedly absent, you're able to step in.
* Have your keybinds, UI, and environment set up so you can focus.
  * This means having a comfortable chair, drink, snacks, etc.
  * Ensure that your machine is patched well in advance of the event.
* If your unit is using voice comms, make sure your mic is prepped and audio balanced.
* Be early! Try to be five minutes early to any hit time -- this isn't always possible, but if you can't make the hit time, communicate it to your leadership.
* Read your class' guides at https://vulkk.com/2022/02/23/swtor-7-0-class-guides-list/.

## Requirements for Endgame Content

Veteran flashpoints, world bosses, datacron runs, and Heroics are generally achievable with any gear or level -- one doesn't need to be subscribed. Higher level content will generally require a subscription and level 80 -- make sure that if you sign up for endgame content, you fit these. After that, it becomes a question of gearing and skill.

* MMFP and SM Ops need you to be at least iRating 320 on gear.
* Unranked PvP and HM Ops need you to be at or near Rating 330. One will need to know the mechanics of the fight, have good footwork and positioning, etc.
* Ranked PvP and Nightmare Mode (NiM) content needs augmented iRating 330 and bleeding-edge knowledge of your class against other classes as well as maps & fight mechanics.

## Fitness and Marksmanship

Every soldier needs to keep up on their personal fitness, marksmanship, and qualifications -- all of these are fading assets, and one needs to maintain them.

Once you have your gear and rotation from the guide, you should be practicing when not working with your unit. This means putting your time in with Heroics, PUG Vet Flashpoints, GSF, and Unranked PvP queues. This should let you work on various fight mechanics, test your gear and rotation, etc. The currencies pulled from this content lets you push your gearing to new levels while improving your personal aptitude.

When you aren't working on group content, try to work towards getting new or recertififying in any of the [operator certifications](./Operator_Certification.md). These make for good goals to keep you motivated when you aren't working with your unit.

## StarParse

[StarParse](http://www.ixparse.com/) is a tool for checking your stats in SWTOR. You can use it solo or as part of a group. With recent updates from SWTOR on combat logging, one doesn't even need to be in a raid group to parse for the group.

Simple way to set it up is to do the following:
* Download and install from http://www.ixparse.com/.
* In the game go to Settings > Game > Combat Logging and toggle `Enable combat logging to file`.
* In StarParse, go to File > Settings > Raiding, and add the ImperialIntel raid group with the posted password.
* In StarParse, make sure you have ImperialIntel checked under Raiding.

Now you're set up! To parse, all you have to do is be in the game and have StarParse open. From there, in StarParse, click the Parse and Raiding buttons in the top and the overlay will pop up. Start fighting a dummy or start working on a flashpoint, and you'll see your stats filter in.

## OPSEC

OPSEC is ensuring your personal security -- keeping yourself safe ensures the unit can rely on your identity in and out of game, and it makes it difficult for external forces to stop you from being able to attend events.

* HAVE A TWO-FACTOR KEY ON YOUR ACCOUNT. I cannot stress how important this is.
* Separate your Discord handle and game identity from your real-life -- this makes it harder for disgruntled players to social-engineer your experience.
* Stay out of genchat. It's cancer.
* Don't antagonize in PvP environments -- just `/ignore` any toxic player and move on. 
* Be generally polite, respectful, and prompt when working with PUG groups or allied guilds.

# Group Leadership

## Pre-Combat Checks

Leaders should make a habit of performing PCC's or pre-combat checks. Below is a short checklist for each member within your unit. These should be performed for yourself and everyone you're responsible for.

- [ ] Do they have a stim boost on? Tanks should have a defense boost -- heals should have a critical. DPS should use a critical for PvP and accuracy for PVE
- [ ] Do they have the right relics, tacticals, & implants for their class and role?
- [ ] Do they have the right ear piece? Tanks should have a defense; heals and DPS should have a critical.
- [ ] Do they have the right accuracy? DPS & tanks should have 105% for PvP or 110% for PvE. Healers don't need any.
- [ ] Do they have the right alacrity? This should be around 7.15% for a 1.4s global cooldown (GCD).
- [ ] Do they have medpacks and adrenals?
- [ ] Is their environment set up? Snacks, drinks, comfortable space, mic, etc.?
- [ ] Do they know their role?

If you are leading the ops group, you should ensure these checks pass for yourself: 

- [ ] Do you have the Legacy perks for banks, mail, and repair droids off cooldown?
- [ ] Do you have the Legacy perks for markers?
- [ ] Can you summon via the guild flagship or groupfinder?
- [ ] Do you know the fights you're leading for? If not, research whatever flashpoint or op you're leading so you know the shortcuts, mechanics, and pitfalls.
- [ ] Do you have your ops frames set?
- [ ] Do you have roles assigned within your unit?

## Nonverbal cues

Especially when going into a PUG group, verbal cues are inaccessible, and typing in the middle of a fight is hard. Ensure you have keybinds for the eight markers, and paste the following into your PUG groups when leading. Using these in a group with voice comms cuts down on extra chatter and lets folks talk through higher-order mechanics or 

```
Hello! Thanks for joining. Please don't pull until the tank attacks -- focus down on fire first, then target. Tank will kite shield; stealthers CC gear icon. Sound off if you have strats you like.
We will readycheck before boss fights -- otherwise pull will be at the tank's discretion. Healer should call out if the group needs to slow down.
```

As the text suggests...

* Fire means a priority target -- burn it down. 
* Target will be the secondary target. It's a good idea to make this your focus target, so that you can watch it while working on the priority target.
  * In 4-Player content, this is killed after fire.
  * In 8- and 16-player content, fire and target should die at the same time. Left frame takes fire, right frame takes target, and the bottom DPS on each frame should be ready to swap if needed.
* Shield is a kite for the tank.
  * DPS on this target doesn't matter until the end of the fight or mechanic -- DWT or tank should focus on leading it around the map.
  * Alternatively, shield may indicate the player acting as a tank.
* Gear is the stealth CC, in-combat hard CC, or friendly conversation target.
* Supplemental icons can be used contextually.
  * Lightening is a pull target.
  * Star is a knockback target.
  * Blaster is a ranged DPS target. 
  * Saber is a melee DPS target.
* Placed markers should be where people stand -- DPS & heals should stand on their markers; tanks should try to kite the boss to theirs and leap off the DPS marker.
