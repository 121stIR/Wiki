# Units

Troopers are only as good as the unit they're working with. Look at your fight to know specifically what composition you need, but each four-player team should fit these criteria.

* One focus DPS -- this should usually be your slower, shorter-range DPS. This could be the most junior role since they can focus on their rotation and don't have to worry about as much of the larger fight.
* One "adds" DPS -- this should be your more mobile, long-range DPS that can quickly burn down additional NPC's and retarget the correct priority.
* One threat-holder -- this can be a full-blown tank or a damage-with-taunt (DWT). 
* One healer -- this can be a full-blown healer or a class with offheals and a cleanse.
